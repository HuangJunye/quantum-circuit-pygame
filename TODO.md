- [ ] Make cursor appearance indicate condition such as unable to place a gate
- [ ] Handle Toffoli gates. For now, control qubit is assumed to be in ctrl_a variable with ctrl_b variable reserved for Toffoli gates
- [ ] Simplify the logic in input_move_ctrl; consider not actually ever placing a TRACE, but rather always dynamically calculating if a TRACE should be displayed.
- [ ] For controlled gates, delete_controls_for_gate should remove the connecting TRACE parts between the gate and the control delete_controls_for_gate
